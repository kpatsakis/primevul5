	 *   VM_PFNMAP tells the core MM that the base pages are just
	 *	raw PFN mappings, and do not have a "struct page" associated
	 *	with them.
	 *
	 * There's a horrible special case to handle copy-on-write
	 * behaviour that some programs depend on. We mark the "original"
	 * un-COW'ed pages by matching them up with "vma->vm_pgoff".
