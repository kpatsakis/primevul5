	 * bit in 'tmp', and return that <source, dest> pair for migration.
	 * The pair of nodemasks 'to' and 'from' define the map.
	 *
	 * If no pair of bits is found that way, fallback to picking some
	 * pair of 'source' and 'dest' bits that are not the same.  If the
	 * 'source' and 'dest' bits are the same, this represents a node
	 * that will be migrating to itself, so no pages need move.
	 *
	 * If no bits are left in 'tmp', or if all remaining bits left
	 * in 'tmp' correspond to the same bit in 'to', return false
	 * (nothing left to migrate).
	 *
	 * This lets us pick a pair of nodes to migrate between, such that
	 * if possible the dest node is not already occupied by some other
	 * source node, minimizing the risk of overloading the memory on a
	 * node that would happen if we migrated incoming memory to a node
	 * before migrating outgoing memory source that same node.
	 *
	 * A single scan of tmp is sufficient.  As we go, we remember the
	 * most recent <s, d> pair that moved (s != d).  If we find a pair
	 * that not only moved, but what's better, moved to an empty slot
	 * (d is not set in tmp), then we break out then, with that pair.
	 * Otherwise when we finish scanning from_tmp, we at least have the
	 * most recent <s, d> pair that moved.  If we get all the way through
	 * the scan of tmp without finding any node that moved, much less
	 * moved to an empty node, then there is nothing left worth migrating.
