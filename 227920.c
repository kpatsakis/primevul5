	 * If we do not, we get strongly overestimated rto. With timestamps
	 * samples are accepted even from very old segments: f.e., when rtt=1
	 * increases to 8, we retransmit 5 times and after 8 seconds delayed
	 * answer arrives rto becomes 120 seconds! If at least one of segments
	 * in window is lost... Voila.	 			--ANK (010210)
