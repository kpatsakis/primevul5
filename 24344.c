  /*
    Some auxiliary operations
    (e.g. GRANT processing) create TABLE_LIST instances outside
    the parser. Additionally, some commands (e.g. OPTIMIZE) change
    the lock type for a table only after parsing is done. Luckily,
    these do not fire triggers and do not need to pre-load them.
    For these TABLE_LISTs set_trg_event_type is never called, and
    trg_event_map is always empty. That means that the pre-locking
    algorithm will ignore triggers defined on these tables, if
    any, and the execution will either fail with an assert in
    sql_trigger.cc or with an error that a used table was not
    pre-locked, in case of a production build.

    TODO: this usage pattern creates unnecessary module dependencies
    and should be rewritten to go through the parser.
    Table list instances created outside the parser in most cases
    refer to mysql.* system tables. It is not allowed to have
    a trigger on a system table, but keeping track of
    initialization provides extra safety in case this limitation
    is circumvented.
