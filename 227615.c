    Reconstruction and Prefiltering of the pixels in the resampling.  It also
    means it is always likely to have at least 4 pixels within the area of the
    ellipse, for weighted averaging.  No scaling will result with F == 4.0 and
    a circle of radius 2.0, and F smaller than this means magnification is
    being used.

    NOTE: This method produces a very blury result at near unity scale while
    producing perfect results for strong minitification and magnifications.

    However filter support is fixed to 2.0 (no good for Windowed Sinc filters)
